# Streaming Inventory Processing - User Experience Improvement

## Before (Blocking Experience)
```
User takes photo
    ↓ (wait 30-60 seconds...)
GPT-4 + All Landing AI + All Uploads complete
    ↓
"Your items are ready!"
    ↓
User reviews items one by one
```

**Problems:**
- Long wait with no feedback
- User can't do anything until ALL processing is done
- If one object fails, everything feels stuck

## After (Streaming Experience)  
```
User takes photo
    ↓ (2-3 seconds)
GPT-4 completes: "Found 3 items: chair, table, lamp!"
    ↓ (immediately)
User sees queue status & can start reviewing first item
    ↓ (background processing continues)
Landing AI finishes "chair" → Available for review
    ↓ (user already working on first item)
Landing AI finishes "table" → Added to queue
    ↓ (seamless flow)
Landing AI finishes "lamp" → Added to queue
```

**Benefits:**
- Immediate feedback after GPT-4 (2-3 sec vs 30-60 sec)
- Progressive disclosure - items become available as processed
- Better perceived performance - user feels productive immediately
- Fault tolerance - failed items don't block others

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Backend Changes
- **Immediate Response**: Return GPT-4 results with `processing_id`
- **Background Processing**: Process Landing AI sequentially in background
- **Status Tracking**: In-memory session tracking with status updates
- **Polling Endpoint**: `/api/processing-status/:processingId` for real-time updates

### 2. Frontend Changes  
- **Progressive UI**: Show items as they become available
- **Queue Visualization**: Visual indicators for processing status
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling every 5 seconds for new items
- **Responsive Design**: User can start working immediately

### 3. User Experience Flow
```javascript
// Immediate response after photo
{
  "step": "gpt_complete",
  "objects": [
    {"name": "chair", "status": "pending_detection"},
    {"name": "table", "status": "pending_detection"}, 
    {"name": "lamp", "status": "pending_detection"}
  ],
  "room": "Living Room",
  "processing_id": "1699123456789"
}

// Progressive updates via polling
{
  "status": "processing",
  "completedCount": 1,
  "totalCount": 3,
  "objects": [
    {"name": "chair", "status": "complete", "imageUrl": "..."},
    {"name": "table", "status": "processing"},
    {"name": "lamp", "status": "pending"}
  ]
}
```

## Queue Status UI
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
